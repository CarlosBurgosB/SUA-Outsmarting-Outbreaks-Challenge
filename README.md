# SUA-Outsmarting-Outbreaks-Challenge

My solution to the SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks challenge by Zindi. The goal of the challenge was to the number of patients for 7 different diseases in each month of the Year 2023.

The diseases are:
- Cholera
- Diarrhea
- Dysentery
- Intestinal Worms
- Malaria
- Schistosomiasis
- Typhoid

The whole EDA, preprocessing, Feature Engineering and Model Cross Validation is available in the notebook provided in this repository. Submission notebook is not available since the challenge has already closed.
